    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>YSound is a NodeJS application implemented using the <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> framework for the purpose of allowing users to access the audio of youtube videos, either for streaming or downloading. My implementation lives at <a href="http://kevinrankine.com/watch">http://kevinrankine.com/watch</a>, running on an AWS EC2 m1.medium Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS instance listening on Port 80.</p><p>I've tested the implementation on both Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS t1.micro and m1.medium instances with SSH (port 22), HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) enabled.</p><p><strong>Setup and installation</strong></p><p>To install all the dependencies on Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS, execute <code>./setup.sh</code>, which installs recent versions of Node.js (v0.10.22), npm (1.3.14), and ffmpeg (0.8.9-4) (along with the required codecs). If <code>setup.sh</code> is not executable, execute <code>chmod +x setup.sh</code> first.</p><p>If you're trying to run the server on an OS other than Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS, you have to download and compile recent versions of Node, NPM, and ffmpeg (along with relevant codecs like libmp3lame instead of just blindly using <code>setup.sh</code>. I can't guarantee this will work, seeing as I've only tested this project on Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS.</p><p>Then run <code>npm install</code> in the root directory of the project, which will install all the node dependencies (external modules required for the operation of the software) into <code>/node_modules</code>.</p><p>After this, execute <code>chmod +x web.js</code>. To start the server, execute <code>sudo nohup ./web.js &amp;&gt; server.log &amp;</code> to run the server in the background (with error messages outputted to server.log). To stop the server execute <code>ps -ax | grep web.js</code> and kill the main process. The server listens on port 80.</p><p><strong>Usage</strong></p><p>Since Firefox does not support mp3 in the HTML5 audio element (without special add ons) to Firefox), streaming is not supported on Firefox. Otherwise, it works on Chrome and Safari (I haven't tested IE since I can't). On mobile it works well on Android (bootstrap made it easy to make a nice UI for mobile).</p><p>Accessing <code>/watch</code> brings up a search interface. After searching, you pick one of the links to listen to a video with the url looking like <code>/watch?q=loft+music</code> where "loft music" was the user's search. Then listen (or download the video if you want) where the url will look like <code>/watch?v=ad-fsOa1f2</code> where "ad-fsOa1f2" is the ID of the selected video. In this case, the <code>src</code> attribute of the audio element would be <code>/videos/ad-fsOa1f2</code>.</p><p><strong>API</strong></p><p>In terms of routes, there are 6 relevant types of URI's:</p><p><code>/</code> sends a page with a link to the search interface.</p><p><code>/watch</code> with no GET parameters directs to the search interface via which a user can search for a video they want to listen to.</p><p><code>/watch</code> with parameter <code>q</code> provides a listing of the search results for the videos specified by the users search query <code>q</code>.</p><p><code>/watch</code> with the parameter <code>v</code> provides a page containing an audio element whose source is an mp3 version of the sound of the video with ID specified by <code>v</code>.</p><p><code>/videos/videoID</code> where <code>videoID</code> is the ID of a youtube video sends the mp3 data of the youtube video specified by videoID to the client.</p><p>Any other URI sends a 404 error.</p><p><strong>Caveats</strong></p><p>The only thing that might need to change for the application to function properly is the variable <code>CSS_LINK_SELECTOR</code> in <code>web.js</code>, which selects link elements to videos on a listing page (youtube implements this, so I don't have control over it - I didn't want to use one of their API's either, because I didn't want to violate their terms of service directly).</p><p>Finally, certain videos (mostly VEVO videos) tend not to work, so if looking for a song, it's best to append lyrics to the end of the query.</p>
